After digging around, I couldn’t find anything that captured the traditional look I envisioned—beautiful wooden handles paired with blade steel you'd trust your life with in the wilderness. </p><p>Having worked with premium hand tools before, I felt we could create a saw that not only looked great but performed even better. But as I shared this vision with Ulf, I realized why others weren’t already doing it—making a durable, stainless-steel saw with knife-grade steel wasn't simple. Finding a steel that was tough enough for serious outdoor work but not brittle, and that manufacturers could actually work with, turned into a months-long journey. </p><p>Since many high-end bushcraft knives use 12C28 or 14C27 stainless steel, we started experimenting with those options in both pre-hardened and raw forms, with hardening the full blades and trying to harden just the teeth without getting close to the performance level we were looking for. Being a startup, finding options in small enough batches that we could afford to buy and waiting for each to arrive was a frustrating journey. After many discussions with the product experts at Alleima we started discussing a new option, a 10C28Mo stainless steel which is usually found in razor blades and kitchen knives but is not very common in the bushcraft products. And how happy were we when it ended up being a great option, a perfect balance of tough while being able to hold an edge.  </p><p>Along the way of finding the perfect stainless steel quality, I had a bit of an \"aha\" moment—high-carbon steel, like what’s used in traditional saws, is a damn good option too! That’s how we ended up with two versions: one in stainless steel for those who love the corrosion resistance and uniqness with that high steel quialty, and another in black oxidized high-carbon steel for those who appreciate that classic option.  </p><p>We're excited to share these saws with you. Whether you’re deep in the backcountry or just enjoying a day in the woods, we think you’ll love them as much as we do. </p><p> <em>Elma Delic – Co-founder</em>  </p>"

The river is a very prominent feature in the countryside surrounding our factory, so it felt natural to borrow our name from it.
