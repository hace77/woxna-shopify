Woxna was founded after a series of random meetings between me and my co-founder Ulf. He is a second generation saw manufacturer and has taken over his company from his father. As our paths crossed, we both saw a great opportunity to try something new and different. Ulf is the brain behind our first product launch and for me this adventure has become an opportunity to finally try my dream of running my own business and working with fantastic products, people and the great outdoors.\"</em></p><p>Elma</p><p>Co-founder, Woxna </p><p></p><p></p>"
